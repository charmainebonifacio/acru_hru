# The ACRU-HRU Delineation Tool

The ACRU-HRU Delineation Tool was developed to automate the delineation of hydrological response units (HRU) for the ACRU (v336) model. The creation of HRU is a key step in utilizing ACRU in a distributed mode. Spatial data are pre-processed according to the userâ€™s specification for a particular watershed. Essentially, the tool allows the user to automatically delineate the HRU using ArcPY modules available in ArcGIS for Desktop.
